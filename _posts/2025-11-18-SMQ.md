This project implements a lightweight publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging server that allows different parts of a website to communicate in real time through simple topic-based messaging. Clients can connect to the server, subscribe to specific topics, and instantly receive any messages published to those topics without needing to constantly poll the server. When a client publishes a message, the server efficiently distributes it to all active subscribers of the corresponding topic, acting as a minimal message broker that supports asynchronous delivery and basic in-memory queuing. This design makes it ideal for features like live chat, notifications, activity feeds, or any system where events need to be broadcast quickly and reliably to multiple listeners.

Check out a quick video of an implementation of the messaging queue in action below!
